# Deep-Learning---Foundations-and-Concepts

## Tuesday, June 18, 2024

This will be my repository created for the walk through of the book "Deep Learning - Foundations and Concepts" by Christopher Bishop. There is no official repository associated with this book but I thought creating one could be a useful learning exercise.

    I created the conda environment 'dlfac' for this task: 

    1) mamba create -n dlfac python=3.11
    2) mamba activate dlfac
    3) mamba install conda-forge::jupyterlab
    4) mamba install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
    5) mamba install conda-forge::scikit-learn
    6) mamba install conda-forge::matplotlib
